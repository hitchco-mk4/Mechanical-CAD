Parts were modeled in Solidworks and manufactured mostly using 3D printing. The actual dashboard pieces laser cut from either 1/4" walnut or 1/8" anodized aluminium. All of the 3D printed parts were printed on a [Prusa i3 MK2](https://www.prusaprinters.org/original-prusa-i3-mk2-release/) FDM printer using [PolyMide CoPA](http://www.polymaker.com/shop/polymidecopa/) from Polymaker. This material was selected due to it's strength and resistance to high heat.

It was very difficult to get the hang of printing the large, flat parts for this project using a material prone to warping, so I've written a printing guide which you can read [here](http://www.esologic.com/how-to-print-polâ€¦n-a-prusa-i3-mk2/).

One part, the oring, was printed using [Ninjaflex](https://ninjatek.com/products/filaments/ninjaflex/).

This repo contains:

* The final STL files for all the 3d printed parts
* DXF files for the laser cut dashboard pieces
* Slic3r configuration profiles for the CoPA
 
The bill of materials for the fasteners / buttons etc can be found [here](https://github.com/hitchco-mk4/Controller-Electrical-Schematics/).
